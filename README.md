# TDDJS
Example of JS TDD

Here is a copy of our TDD js project, not complete by any means just a project for us to learn TDD JS. I have removed all angular code but there may be some files remaining. 


test em: test runner
lineman: http://linemanjs.com/
jasmine: testing framework, http://jasmine.github.io/
nodejs: https://nodejs.org/en/
testDouble: Mocking framework, https://github.com/testdouble

Downloading and installing some of these will need to be done outside of the NW network.
